This is my solution to [**DIWE**](https://diwe.com.br/)'s technical challenge for the
**Junior Back-end Developer** position.

[The challenge](https://github.com/diwe-engineering/challenge-backend-jr)
consists of building a **REST API** to serve data to a financial management system.
I have also created a public [**Trello board**](https://trello.com/b/gNnSkVn0/diwe-challenge-jr-back-end-developer)
for the project to allow for the tracking of its progress.

## Problem Domain

As stated before, the challenge consists of building a REST API to serve data to
a financial management system. So to better understand the problem domain and make
sure the developed solution would fit the problem description, I did some research
about financial management systems and also referred to some systems of this kind
I have used in the past.

After this research, I decided my implementation would be geared towards a personal
finance management platform, like [Mobills](https://www.mobills.com.br/), [Organizze](https://www.organizze.com.br/)
(both quite popular in Brazil) and [Mint](https://mint.intuit.com/).

There are **two** main reasons for that:

1. It makes the problem more familiar to me in comparison with an equivalent
   system geared towards a company, for example.
2. It seems to fit better the database structure suggested by the challenge,
   as detailed below.

The fine people at [**DIWE**](https://diwe.com.br/) gave me **explicit permission** to host this project on a public repository so I could include it in my portfolio.
