# DIWE Challenge - Jr. Back-end Developer

My solution to [**DIWE**](https://diwe.com.br/)'s technical challenge for the
Junior Back-end Developer position. [The challenge](https://github.com/diwe-engineering/challenge-backend-jr)
consists of building a REST API to serve data to a financial management system.
I have also created a public [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/gNnSkVn0/diwe-challenge-jr-back-end-developer)
for the project to allow for the tracking of its progress.
